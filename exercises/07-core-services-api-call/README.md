# Exercise 07 - Making the API call and understanding the results

We've finally made it to the stage where we can make the call!

The journey so far has been deliberately focused on the details that we need to pay attention to, so we understand what we're doing when we have to create a service key and make an OAuth 2.0 call to get an access token. Now we have that token, let's use it!

## Final preparation

We know that we want to make a call to the one endpoint in the Regions for Global Account group in the Entitlements Service API, i.e. to:

```text
/entitlements/v1/globalAccountAllowedDataCenters
```

and that we have an access token obtained through a successful completion of the OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials ("Password") flow.

### Managing the service key and token data files

The result of that process has left us with two files, both of which we still need.

|File|Content|What we need|
|-|-|-|
|`cis-central-sk.json`|Service key data|The Entitlements Service API base URL in `.credentials.endpoints.entitlements_service_url`|
|`tokendata.json`|OAuth 2.0 data|The access token in `access_token`|

As we created these files in the previous exercise, they're in that corresponding exercise directory. But as we'll be working in this exercise's directory now, let's leave the files where they are (so we remember in which exercise we created them) and create symbolic links from this exercise's directory to point to them, so we can refer to them in a simple way here.

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure you're in this exercise's directory, and then create symbolic links for both files:

```bash
cd $HOME/projects/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/exercises/07-core-services-api-call/
ln -s ../06-core-services-api-creds/cis-central-sk.json .
ln -s ../06-core-services-api-creds/tokendata.json .
```

Now you have the file names in your current directory that you can use.

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look and try it out:

```bash
ls -l *.json
jq keys tokendata.json
```

You should see output similar to this:

```text
user: 07-core-services-api-call $ ls -l *.json
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user 1337 49 Aug 17 08:50 cis-central-sk.json -> ../06-core-services-api-creds/cis-central-sk.json
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user 1337 44 Aug 17 08:50 tokendata.json -> ../06-core-services-api-creds/tokendata.json
user: 07-core-services-api-call $ jq keys tokendata.json
[
  "access_token",
  "expires_in",
  "id_token",
  "jti",
  "refresh_token",
  "scope",
  "token_type"
]
user: 07-core-services-api-call $
```

### Checking the access token and API base URL

The two key values that we need are the access token itself, along with the base URL for the API call (i.e. the base URL to which we then append `/entitlements/v1/globalAccountAllowedDataCenters`).

With your new `jq` filtering skills, tease out these two values to have a look at them.

ðŸ‘‰ First, have a look at the base URL:

```bash
jq --raw-output .credentials.endpoints.entitlements_service_url cis-central-sk.json
```

You should see something like this:

```text
https://entitlements-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now have a quick look at the access token; use `jq`'s [string slice](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Array/StringSlice:.[10:15]) to only return a portion of it, because you don't need to see all of it (you just want to check it's there and looks how you'd expect), and it's better for security:

```bash
jq --raw-output '.access_token[:50]' tokendata.json
```

You should see something like this:

```text
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImprdSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vOGZlN2VmZD
```

## Make the call

You now have everything you need to make the call to the API endpoint. The data is just a single, simple HTTP call away.

Let's do it manually first, with `curl`. In contrast to the HTTP call we made in the previous exercise, there is only one header that we need to have sent in the request, explicitly (there will be other headers sent by `curl` automatically).

ðŸ‘‰ Execute this `curl` request:

```bash
curl \
  --url "$(jq -r .credentials.endpoints.entitlements_service_url cis-central-sk.json)/entitlements/v1/globalAccountAllowedDataCenters" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $(jq -r .access_token tokendata.json)"
```

> In the `curl` invocation in the previous exercise, we saw (using the `--verbose` option) something like this in the output: `> Authorization: Basic c2ItdXQtZTQ4ZDQ5N2UtMWI4MS00...`.
>
> This is a Basic Authentication HTTP header that was created automatically by `curl` as a result of the `--user` option, and the content following the authorization scheme name ("Basic") is a combination of the username and password (joined with a colon) and then encoded with base64.
>
> In this `curl` invocation we're making now, we cannot use Basic Authentication because our request would be rejected as the server does not accept that sort of authorization. (Remember, this is the Resource Server that we're talking to now, not the Authorization Server - see the link to [Understand OAuth 2.0 grant types](https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-apis-virtual-event/tree/main/exercises/02#3-understand-oauth-20-grant-types) in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section below to get this straight in your head). Instead, we need to use a Bearer token authorization scheme, which consists of the scheme name "Bearer" followed by ... you guessed it, our access token.
>
> In case you're wondering, the `$(...)` construction used in this header (as well as in the `--url` option) is command substitution in Bash, i.e. whatever is within the brackets is executed and then the output of that is substituted. So in this case we get the access token value.
>
> See the [Further reading](#further-reading) section at the end of this exercise for links to more information on these topics.

The simple script [call-entitlements-service-regions-api](../../scripts/call-entitlements-service-regions-api), a link to which is in this directory, is a slightly more robust and repeatable way of invoking the `curl` command above (i.e. you're not using subshells "in flight" to retrieve values from files). Like the `generate-password-grant-type` script, it also requires the service key JSON data file (so it can retrieve the value of the `entitlements_service_url` endpoint) ... it also requires the name of the token data JSON file.

ðŸ‘‰ Have [a look at the script](../../scripts/call-entitlements-service-regions-api) if you wish, then invoke it, passing the output to `jq` to prettify it:

```bash
./call-entitlements-service-regions-api cis-central-sk.json tokendata.json | jq .
```

You should see some output similar to this:

```json
{
  "datacenters": [
    {
      "name": "cf-ap21",
      "displayName": "Singapore - Azure",
      "region": "ap21",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AZURE",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-us10",
      "displayName": "US East (VA) - AWS",
      "region": "us10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-eu10",
      "displayName": "Europe (Frankfurt) - AWS",
      "region": "eu10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": false,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Does this [look familiar](../04-retrieving-parsing-json-output/README.md#use-the-json-format-output-option)? Of course it does! It's exactly the same as what `btp --format json list accounts/available-region` produced. In other words, the JSON output of the btp CLI invocation is the same as the JSON output from the equivalent API call.

## Summary

Well done, you've made it this far and been on quite a detailed journey to understand what's involved in calling a Core Services API, including identifying the endpoint and the requirements, gathering the credentials, and actually making the call. You've also seen how the btp CLI and the Core Services APIs are very closely related.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. Have a bit of a stare at the [call-entitlements-service-regions-api](../../scripts/call-entitlements-service-regions-api) script, and the associated [lib.sh](../../scripts/lib.sh) library. Is there anything in there that you'd like to know more about?
1. Just before the JSON output in the call to `call-entitlements-service-regions-api`, you saw some progress bar style information on bytes received, time taken, and so on. How would you suppress this output, so you just got the JSON?
