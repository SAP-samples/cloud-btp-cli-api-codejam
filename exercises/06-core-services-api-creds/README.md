# Exercise 06 - Gathering required credentials for the API call

Having determined that we want to make an API call to the singular endpoint in the Regions for Global Account group, i.e. to:

```text
/entitlements/v1/globalAccountAllowedDataCenters
```

we learned in the previous exercise that we needed an instance of the SAP Cloud Management service, and chose the `central` plan to do that with. Given that we intend to create that instance in our Cloud Foundry (CF) environment instance in our subaccount, we spent the rest of the exercise learning how to mine and extract relevant information from the rich seam of SAP BTP resource data that is available to us via the JSON output format with the btp CLI.

Specifically, we worked out how to find, mechanically, the API endpoint that we need to login with the CF CLI `cf`.

In this exercise we'll use that, log in with `cf` and go on to work through the rest of the boxes in this diagram here:

```text
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
|    Service     |      |    Instance    |      |    Binding     |
|      cis       |--+-->|                |----->|                |
|                |  |   |                |      |                |
+----------------+  |   +----------------+      +----------------+
        |           |                                   |
        |           |                                   |
        |           |                                   |
+----------------+  |                                   |
|      Plan      |  |                                   |
|     central    |--+                                   |
|                |                                      |
+----------------+                                      |
                                                        |
        +-----------------------------------------------+
        |
        V
+----------------+      +----------------+
|     Token      |      |    API Call    |
|                |----->|                |
|                |      |                |
+----------------+      +----------------+
```

We will stop just before the "API Call" box, and do that in the subsequent exercise.

## Log in with the CF CLI

With the API endpoint now obtained, we can log in with the CF CLI. You could do it like this, specifying, with the `-a` option, the API endpoint URL you noted down in the previous exercise:

```bash
cf login -a <API endpoint URL>
```

However, you could simply use the power of the shell to do this in one go, as follows.

ðŸ‘‰ Ensure you're in the directory containing this exercise's `README.md` file, and make this call (replacing `trial` with the name of your subaccount):

```bash
cd $HOME/projects/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/exercises/06-core-services-api-creds
cf login -a $(./get_cf_api_endpoint "trial")
```

> The `get_cf_api_endpoint` in this directory is [just a symbolic link](get_cf_api_endpoint) to the [real script](../../scripts/get_cf_api_endpoint) in the shared [scripts/](../../scripts/) directory.

Supply your BTP trial account credentials (email address and password). Here's what the flow will look like:

```text
user: 06-core-services-api-creds $ cf login -a $(./get_cf_api_endpoint "trial")
API endpoint: https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com

Email: qmacro+blue@gmail.com
Password:

Authenticating...
OK

Targeted org 8fe7efd4trial.

Targeted space dev.

API endpoint:   https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
API version:    3.109.0
user:           qmacro+blue@gmail.com
org:            8fe7efd4trial
space:          dev
user: 06-core-service-api-creds $
```

> You should already have a space set up, as described in the [Subaccount and Cloud Foundry environment](../../prerequisites.md#subaccount-and-cloud-foundry-environment) section of the prerequisites.

Just like the btp CLI, the CF CLI also has an option to allow you to use SSO to sign in. If you want, try this approach:

```bash
cf login -a $(./get_cf_api_endpoint "trial") --sso
```

You should be given a URL to navigate to, authenticate, and receive a code to paste in at the prompt, and it should look something like this:

```text
user: 06-core-services-api-creds $ cf login -a $(./get_cf_api_endpoint "trial") --sso
API endpoint: https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com

Temporary Authentication Code ( Get one at https://login.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/passcode ):
Authenticating...
OK

...
```

## Create a service instance and key

ðŸ‘‰ Now you're authenticated, create an instance of the Cloud Management Service, with the "central" plan, as discussed earlier:

> If you already have an instance of this service, you may need to remove it so that you can create this one.

```bash
cf create-service cis central cis-central
```

The output should look something like this:

```text
Creating service instance cis-central in org 8fe7efd4trial / space dev as qmacro+blue@gmail.com...
OK
```

ðŸ‘‰ For this new instance, create a service key:

```bash
cf create-service-key cis-central cis-central-sk
```

The output should look something like this:

```text
Creating service key cis-central-sk for service instance cis-central as qmacro+blue@gmail.com...
OK
```

> The naming convention used here for instance and service key resources has instances named after a combination of service name and plan name (`cis-central`) and a service key named similarly, suffixed with `-sk` here (`cis-central-sk`). You may have your own naming conventions in your organization, but we'll stick to this one for now.

At this point, we can update our diagram with the two new entity names in the `Instance` and `Binding` (service key) boxes:

```text
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
|    Service     |      |    Instance    |      |    Binding     |
|      cis       |--+-->|   cis-central  |----->| cis-central-sk |
|                |  |   |                |      |                |
+----------------+  |   +----------------+      +----------------+
        |           |                                   |
        |           |                                   |
        |           |                                   |
+----------------+  |                                   |
|      Plan      |  |                                   |
|     central    |--+                                   |
|                |                                      |
+----------------+                                      |
                                                        |
        +-----------------------------------------------+
        |
        V
+----------------+      +----------------+
|     Token      |      |    API Call    |
|                |----->|                |
|                |      |                |
+----------------+      +----------------+
```

> We're deliberately interchanging the terms "binding" and "service key" so that they become related in our minds.

At this point in the longer CodeJam version of this workshop, we [take a detour to examine the contents of the service key](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/blob/main/exercises/06-core-services-api-creds/README.md#take-a-first-look-at-the-service-key). Due to the lack of time, we won't do that here; instead, we'll take a quick look before continuing.

### Examine and then store the contents of the service key

ðŸ‘‰ Ask to see the contents of the service key, like this:

```bash
cf service-key cis-central cis-central-sk 
```

You should see something like this:

```text
Getting key cis-central-sk for service instance cis-central as qmacro+blue@gmail.com...

```

That's JSON! Well yes, but not entirely. There are a couple of lines right at the start that are not JSON, some "informational" output (the line starting "Getting", and the empty line that follows) which will mess up our attempts at treating the service key contents as JSON. Also, it's a good idea to store the contents in a file so that we can quickly refer to the details when we need to. So let's clean up the cruft and store the file in one go, like this:

ðŸ‘‰ Re-request the service key, remove the first two lines, and store it in a file:

```bash
cf service-key cis-central cis-central-sk | sed '1,2d' > cis-central-sk.json
```

You can check the file contains just the JSON by asking `jq`, a command line JSON processor, which is available by default in the Dev Space, to print it out nicely:

ðŸ‘‰ Try that now:

```bash
jq . cis-central-sk.json
```

You should see a nicely formatted display of JSON.

> Technically speaking, the `.` in `jq` is the [identity](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Identity:.) filter, so the nice formatting of the JSON is actually just a by-product of asking `jq` to filter the JSON through the identity filter (which just produces whatever it receives), and by default `jq` will endeavour to pretty-print the output. But that's a (long and interesting) story for another time!

Values in this JSON data are needed to:

* request an authorization token (with the `clientid`, `clientsecret` and `url` properties in the `uaa` object)
* make the actual API call (with the `entitlements_service_url` property in the `endpoints` object)

Background details on this are available in the SAP Help Portal page linked in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section below.

## Request the token

Now you can request the token. It's essentially an HTTP request to an OAuth 2.0 endpoint with parameters supplying the grant type, username and password details, and authentication in the form of the `clientid` and `clientsecret` values above.

In this directory, there's a link to a script called [generate-password-grant-type](../../scripts/generate-password-grant-type) that you can run, and at the heart is this `curl` invocation, which gives you an idea of what's going to happen:

```bash
curl \
  --url "$uaa_url/oauth/token" \
  --user "$clientid:$clientsecret" \
  --data 'grant_type=password' \
  --data-urlencode "username=$email" \
  --data-urlencode "password=$password"
```

You're going to run that script now.

ðŸ‘‰ First, make sure you're still in this exercise's directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/projects/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/exercises/06-core-services-api-creds/
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now invoke the script, specifying the name of the file containing the service key JSON data:

```bash
./generate-password-grant-type cis-central-sk.json
```

You'll be asked to authenticate, and you must specify your SAP BTP email and password. If the call is successful, you'll see some JSON output. A good sign! But it's more or less unreadable just output to the terminal in raw form.

ðŸ‘‰ So repeat the invocation and save the output to a file; then you can pick out details with `jq`:

```bash
./generate-password-grant-type cis-central-sk.json > tokendata.json
```

> You can of course simply open the file in your Dev Space editor, but where's the fun in that? Also, if you do, it will most likely be displayed as one, long, unreadable line.

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look what properties there are in this JSON:

```bash
jq 'keys' tokendata.json
```

> You can also omit the single quotes here if you wish, as the shell will pass the `keys` token to `jq` just as well without them.

You should see some output like this:

```json
[
  "access_token",
  "expires_in",
  "id_token",
  "jti",
  "refresh_token",
  "scope",
  "token_type"
]
```

These properties look like the right ones - we have an access token that we can now use to authenticate the API call, and we even have a refresh token to ask for a new one when the current one expires.

> See the reference to the "keys" section of the `jq` manual in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section below to read more on the "keys" function.

Now we can update our diagram to record the fact that we now have a token!

## Summary

You now know how to get a service key (binding) via an instance of a service on SAP BTP, specifically in the CF environment. You also know now what sort of information this service key contains and how you can use it in an OAuth 2.0 flow to request an access token. You're now ready to use the access token to make the API call in the next exercise!

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. Do you recognise the `$(...)` syntax when you ran the `cf` CLI to log in (`cf login -a $(./get_cf_api_endpoint "trial")`)? 
1. What other naming conventions for Cloud Foundry instances and service keys have you seen? Are there ones you prefer to use, and if so, what are they?
1. Take a look at the token data you retrieved - what's the lifetime of the access token, in hours?
