# Exercise 02 - Authenticating and setting your target subaccount

At the end of this exercise, you'll have successfully authenticated with the btp CLI for your SAP BTP account.

## Gather the information required

To authenticate with the btp CLI so you can access and manage the resources in your BTP account, you need certain items of information.

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure you have these items to hand:

|Item|Description|
|-|-|
|btp CLI server URL|The remote endpoint for the btp CLI. This is usually fixed, and is currently `https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com` for all users.|
|Global account subdomain|The subdomain for your global account on SAP BTP.|
|Username|The username with which you log on to the BTP account.|
|Password|The password with which you log on to the BTP account.|

You can see an example of the subdomain for this sample trial global account, just underneath the "Account Explorer" heading:

![trial global account showing subdomain](assets/global-account-subdomain-and-subaccount.png)

## Authenticate

If you managed to check out the "Usage" information and the output from `btp --help` [at the end of the previous exercise](../01-installing/README.md#questions) you'll have seen that there are "General actions" as well as BTP resource specific actions. One of these general actions is "login".

ðŸ‘‰ Use that now to authenticate, supplying the information you gathered in the previous section:

```bash
btp login
```

Here's an example authentication flow for trial global account 8fe7efd4trial:

```text
user: user $ btp login
SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.14.0)

CLI server URL [https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com]>
Connecting to CLI server at https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com...

Global account subdomain>8fe7efd4trial-ga
User>qmacro+blue@gmail.com
Password>

Login successful
We stored your configuration file at: /home/user/.config/.btp/config.json

Current target:
  Global account (subdomain: 8fe7efd4trial-ga)

Tip:
    For more information on the targeting mechanism, use 'btp help target'.

OK
```

Here's another example authentication flow, for a global account with the subdomain "sap-developer-advocates-free-tier", where the user has chosen to use single sign on (SSO) with the browser, using the `--sso manual` parameter:

```text
user: user $ btp login --sso manual
SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.24.0)

CLI server URL [https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com]>
Connecting to CLI server at https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com...

Global account subdomain> sap-developer-advocates-free-tier

Please authenticate at: https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/login/v2.24.0/browser/d1fc0c69-d59e-4f7e-9a34-de852251caaa
Waiting for user authentication to complete (use Ctrl+C to abort)...

Login successful
We stored your configuration file at: /home/user/.config/btp/config.json

Target hierarchy:
  Global account (subdomain: sap-developer-advocates-free-tier)
  â””â”€ Subaccount (ID: bbcd39a3-4047-4e7b-bba2-88604cb7faaa)

Tips:
    Commands are executed in the target, unless specified otherwise using a parameter. To change the target, use 'btp target'.
    For an explanation of the targeting mechanism, use 'btp help target'.

OK
```

> In this example, the user selects the URL presented at the "Please authenticate at" prompt and opens it in the browser, and authenticates there if required. Then the flow automatically continues.

Any issues logging in could be down to a number of factors - for example, if you're using two-factor authentication (2FA), remember to append your 2FA code to your password as you enter it.

## Set your desired subaccount as a target

It's likely that you'll often be wanting to work with some of your SAP BTP resources at the subaccount level. In a trial global account, this is the "trial" subaccount that's automatically created (you can see an example of this "trial" subaccount in the screenshot earlier). It will be different in other accounts.

> The examples in this section will continue to use the trial subaccount but you should follow along using [whatever subaccount you have identified for this CodeJam](../../prerequisites.md#subaccount-and-cloud-foundry-environment). A subaccount is where you'll be normally operating - where you'll have environment instances (Cloud Foundry or Kyma runtimes, for example). Think of the global account as a container for multiple subaccounts.

Rather than have to specify this subaccount each time in various btp CLI invocations, you can tell the btp CLI once, with the `target` general action, and then it will be used when required.

You can find out more about the `target` action, and any action, with the general action `help`, i.e. `btp help target`.

ðŸ‘‰ Do this now, and examine the output:

```bash
btp help target
```

Here's an example invocation:

```text
user: user $ btp help target
Connecting to CLI server at https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com...
Usage: btp [OPTIONS] target [--global-account SUBDOMAIN] [--directory ID] [--subaccount ID]

Set the default context for command execution.

Targeting works along the hierarchy of your account model:
 - After login, the global account is targeted by default.
 - When targeting a subaccount or directory, you can execute commands in its parent directory or global account by using '-dir' or '-ga' without value.
 - Commands that only work on directory or global account level will be executed in the parent directory or global account of the current target.

Parameters:
  --global-account,-ga SUBDOMAIN  (Optional) You can omit SUBDOMAIN as only the global account of the active login can be targeted.
  --directory,-dir ID             (Optional) The ID of the directory to be targeted.
  --subaccount,-sa ID             (Optional) The ID of the subaccount to be targeted. To find your subaccount ID, use 'btp list accounts/subaccount'.

Tips:
    To overwrite the targeted context for a specific command call, you can specify the respective parameter.
    To work in a different global account, log in to this global account using 'btp login'.

Further documentation:
    https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/720645a3ed3945bd8d97a670b948ac07.html

OK
```

So set your desired subaccount as the target now.

ðŸ‘‰ Try this (substituting your subaccount's name for "trial", if it's different):

```bash
btp target --subaccount trial
```

Hmm, that's not quite right, is it?

Here we see there's a distinction between the display name and the ID. The help above, as well as the error message you just saw as a result of not actually specifying a real ID, gives us a clue as to how we find it.

ðŸ‘‰ Do that now, using the "list" action on the "subaccount" object in the "accounts" group:

```bash
btp list accounts/subaccount
```

Here's the sort of thing that you should see:

```text
subaccounts in global account fdce9323-d6e6-42e6-8df0-5e501c90a2be...

subaccount id:                         display name:   subdomain:      region:   beta-enabled:   parent id:                             parent type:     state:   state message:
f78e0bdb-c97c-4cbc-bb06-526695f44551   trial           8fe7efd4trial   eu10      false           fdce9323-d6e6-42e6-8df0-5e501c90a2be   global account   OK       Subaccount created.


OK
```

> By the way, here's where the plural/singular approach to the group and object in the invocation comes in (we thought about this at the end of the previous exercise). In the `btp` invocation you just made, group "accounts" is plural, while the object "subaccount" is singular.

The output should include a detailed line for your subaccount, showing its ID (which starts `f78e0bdb` here - the ID for your subaccount will of course be different) as well as its name (which is `trial` in this example).

ðŸ‘‰ Try the `target` command again, this time specifying the ID of your subaccount, rather than the display name. Here's an example, with output:

```text
user: user $ btp target --subaccount f78e0bdb-c97c-4cbc-bb06-526695f44551
Targeting subaccount 'f78e0bdb-c97c-4cbc-bb06-526695f44551'. Commands that only work on global account level will be executed in the parent global account.

Current target:
  Global account (subdomain: 8fe7efd4trial-ga)
  â””â”€ Subaccount (ID: f78e0bdb-c97c-4cbc-bb06-526695f44551)

Tips:
    To execute a command in the parent global account, use parameter '-ga' without value.
    To execute a command in a different context, specify the subaccount, directory, or global account in the command.

OK
```

Any `btp` invocation output displays what the current target is; note now that not only is the global account targeted but also the subaccount:

```text
Current target:
  Global account (subdomain: 8fe7efd4trial-ga)
  â””â”€ Subaccount (ID: f78e0bdb-c97c-4cbc-bb06-526695f44551)
```

> You can make your command line life more comfortable with custom functions and scripts, such as one to get the ID for a subaccount, given its display name. We'll cover this in [a later exercise in this session](../05-btp-guids-cli-in-practice/README.md). See also [the `bgu` script in action as part of the btp CLI section of the 2021 SAP TechEd Developer Keynote](https://youtu.be/OmEx598qAI8?t=180) and also the two related blog posts in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section below.

## Summary

At this point you've logged in with `btp` and have your global account and "trial" subaccount targeted.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. Did you try to authenticate using Single Sign-On (SSO)? How did it work for you? What about from within a container?
